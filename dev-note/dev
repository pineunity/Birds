for tracking the state using console in javascript


The stateful migration is performed by the following steps:

- Captured and saved the state

- Sync state between source and destination

- Recovery from the state file

When the migration is triggered then we need to sync the following parameters:
- the kind of bird (color)
- the position of the bird
- the position of the pipes
- the background set


- The bird actually does not move, only the background move
