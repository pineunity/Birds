for tracking the state using console in javascript


The stateful migration is performed by the following steps:

- Captured and saved the state

- Sync state between source and destination

- Recovery from the state file

When the migration is triggered then we need to sync the following parameters:
- the kind of bird (color)
- the position of the bird
- the position of the pipes
- the background set


- The bird actually does not move, only the background move


For the live migration, we should also change the background
expected sceen mode: After click the play button

The idea is to:
   - Set up the socket connection
   - Move the player mode without asking for the login
   - After recovery, update the correct location of the pipes


Workflow:

Socket in Start() -- > Migrated event ---> Change state --> Log --> Call some events --> Call back the Start()


Note:
Update only last three pipes
Sync file: Lsyncd (Live Syncing Daemon)
